# Retail-Sales-Analysis

**Retail Sales Analysis Hub Project**

**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates key SQL skills and techniques commonly used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. 
The project involves creating a retail sales database, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering business-related questions through SQL queries.

**Technologies Used**

**Database:** MySQL
**Queries:** SQL (SELECT, GROUP BY, WINDOW FUNCTIONS, CASE Statements)
**Tools:** MySQL Workbench (for managing the database and running queries)

**Objectives**

**- Create and Populate a Retail Sales Database**: Set up a retail sales database by importing and structuring the provided sales data.
**- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Detect and handle any missing or invalid records to ensure data integrity.
**- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct basic analysis to gain insights into the dataset's structure and trends.
**- Business Insights through SQL:** Use SQL queries to answer business questions and uncover actionable insights from the sales data.

**Data Exploration & Cleaning**

The data exploration and cleaning process involved several key steps:

**- Record Count:** Determined the total number of records in the dataset.
**- Customer Count:** Found the number of unique customers in the dataset.
**- Category Count:** Identified all unique product categories within the dataset.
**- Null Value Check:** Checked for any null values in the dataset and removed records with missing data.

**SQL Queries:**

**Findings & Conclusions**

**- Best-selling Month:** The month with the highest sales in each year was identified.
**- Top Categories:** Analyzed the product categories that contributed the most to total sales.
**- Customer Spending:** Identified the top 5 customers based on total spending.
**-Shifts & Orders:** The Evening shift had the highest sales volume.
**-Gender-based Trends:** Analyzed the number of transactions made by each gender across different categories.
